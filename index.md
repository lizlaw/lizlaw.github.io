## Welcome to my page

This site is under (long-term) "construction". For now, see either [my github repositories](https://github.com/lizlaw) for, surprise, my github repositories, or [my workingconservation](https://workingconservation.wordpress.com) for info about my work.  

For now, I'll use this site as a log of MoonBoard problems that I have completed - because I've found it really difficult to find lists of problems for somewhat vertically challenged (160cm) V3 level climbers who want to start out on the MoonBoard to get better. 

These are for the 2019 setup with all hold sets.

These are in approximate order of completion, whatever that really means. 

Some tips that have helped me so far:

* Try and keep a foot on, especially when doing more dynamic moves. Press my toe down into the back of the hold, if possible.
* Pinch holds, rather than drag, where possible.
* Often I need to set a higher foot than ideal for my current position (or set a foot that I would otherwise flag) - to make the position I am moving to easier to hold.
* If my feet cut, get them back on ASAP. 
* Just try harder.

### V3 

* **Do it for the scrunch** - One of my first MB sucesses, smaller climbers might ask, what scrunch??
* **For tiny climbers** - Nice 'easy' one up the middle of the board
* **Girls just wanna have fun** - A slightly easier introduction of the left-to-right diagonal of the board.
* **Lättplätt** - Lots of holds, but feels a bit scrunchy, even for me.  
* **Trying to make the moon easy** - Similar to Lättplätt, but on the LHS.
* **Damn easy** - Somewhat true to it's name. I kept falling off the bottom until I brought my feet up to the top row of footchips.
* **Squirrel drool** - An introduction to the H12-I15 'pop'
* **Kat in the hat** - A classic left-to-right diagonal, with a delicate middle. 
* **Für Alois** - One of my hardest so far - requiring recovering from when my feet cut going form B8-E10, and the little 'crossover' in the middle took some work (I match hands on most of the lower holds, I can't hold the crossover otherwise).
